Conclusion
==========

This concludes our introductory training on Docker for Development with Drupal.  We've covered:

* Constructing and maintaining an application stack with Docker Compose
* Constructing a custom container image using a Dockerfile
* Configuring environment variables and writing entryscripts for Docker images
* Building a Makefile for convenience
* Adding developer tools such as Mailhog and Selenium to our application stack
* Configuring Travis for continuous testing using our application stack

There is some very good documentation on the Docker website on the use of Docker and Docker Compose.  There is also some very good tutorials on Docker in the developer community.  I will caution you to use these materials with caution; the Docker project has been rapidly evolving and developing, and as such materials written even a few months ago become quickly outdated, especially if they are written using beta components, which may not be present in a stable release, or whose functionality may have changed since a particular piece was authored.
